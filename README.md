# Fire Nation Royal Palace
As a big fan of Avatar, I wanted to model my project in the series' essence. This was more of a research and development project with other for fun components. This is a web app that uses Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS to incorporate the three functionalities listed below:

## AI/Deep Learning Chatbot
I cannot claim credit for this portion of the code. I took an interest in AI/ML/DL recently and wanted to do more in depth examination on the topic. I understand that as technology continues to progress, AI will probably play a big part as time goes on. I know some businesses use a chatbot and so I thought I'd try to create one as well. I read tons of articles and watched and followed along to many tutorials on this and what you see on the Iroh page is a result of this.

# Zuko
## Recent Avatar News/Posts Feed

## Snake Game
I love games and wanted to reminisce our first project as to how far we've come along in this Software Engineering bootcamp so I created a simple snake game in an Avatar theme. I tried to customize the snake and the apple and was somewhat successful but it still requires more work before I can deploy it.
